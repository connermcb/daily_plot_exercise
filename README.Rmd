## About

This repo is a simple container for my practice plots. I work with _ggplot_, _matplotlib_, and _Tableau_ primarily to build attractive visualizations. The goal is to build a plot a day and add it to this container. As the title notes, I don't to adding a plot quite everyday...

## The Plots
**Plot 22 September 22, 2018:** The trellis plot is means of effectively controlling for categorical variables by plotting separately the intersections between the levels of these variables. The `xyplot()` function is part of the lattice package which is specifically designed for producing trellis plots. Here's an example, that separates or facets a two-variable scatter plot by the levels of third variable using panels or frames for each level of the control variable:

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# get pkgs and data
library(lattice)
attach(Puromycin)

# plot 
xyplot(rate ~ conc | state, pch=18, main = "Trellis Plot Example", 
       xlab = "Substrate Concentration", ylab = "Reaction Rate")

# clean up
detach(Puromycin)
```


**Plot 21 September 18, 2018:** Today's plot uses the scatter plot function in the `car` package. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# packages and data
library(car)
attach(trees)

# plot
scatterplot(Girth~Height, col = 'black',
            regLine = list(method = lm, lty = 1, lwd = 1, col = 'green'),
            smooth = list(smoother = loessLine,  
                          lty.smooth = 2, lty.spread = 4, lwd.smooth = 2,
                          lwd.spread = 1, col.smooth = 'red', col.spread = 'red'),
            main = "Sample of Scatterplot (car package)")


# clean up
detach(trees)

```


**Plot 20 September 9, 2018:** Today is a single plot similar to the comibnation histogram and line plot in the last study. This time the default axis labels will be suppressed in favor of custom labels that give more information about independent and dependent variables.

**Plot 18 September 5, 2018:** Next up is a study of scatter plots using _Graphing Data with R_. I think of scatter plots as akin to strip plots over two dimensions instead of just one. This is a versatile plot, not only allowing you to look at distributions or identify trends, but also to identify outliers and data points with potentially undue leverage. Depending on how the plot is implemented (i.e with labels or information contained in a hover tool), scatter plots can also be used to examine individual data points and compare their values to other points.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# get data and create subset
attach(trees)
trees2 = trees[1:2,]

# set plot frame params
par(mfrow=c(2,2), cex=0.7)

# plot 1
plot(trees2$Height, trees2$Girth,
     xlim = c(60,85),
     ylim = c(8, 10),
     xlab = "Tree Height",
     ylab = "Tree Girth",
     main = "a. First Two Observations")

# plot 1 annotations
text(trees2[1,2], trees2[1,1], 
     labels = paste("Height =", trees2[1,2], ", Girth =", trees2[1,1]),
     xlim = c(61,80), 
     ylim = c(8, 22),
     adj = c(0.5, 1.5))

text(trees2[2,2], trees2[2,1], 
     labels = paste(trees2[2,2], ",", trees2[2,1]),
     xlim = c(62,89), 
     ylim = c(8, 22),
     adj = c(0.5, -1.5))

# Plot 2
plot(Height, Girth, main = "b. Basic Scatter Plot")

# Plot 3
plot(Height, Girth, 
     pch = 20,
     col = "deepskyblue",
     main = "c. Customized Plot")
     grid(col = "gray70")
     
# Plot 4
plot(Height, Girth, 
     pch = 20,
     col = "deepskyblue",
     main = "d. Regression Line")
     grid(col = "gray70")
abline(lm(Girth ~ Height), 
       lty = 1,lwd = 2,
       col = "dodgerblue4")

# clean up

```



**Plot 17 September 3, 2018**
Rug plots are appended to other types of charts in order to show single variable distributions that might otherwise not be apparent in the principal chart. Rug plots are conceptually similar to strip plots.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# get pkgs and data
library(multcomp)

# set plot params
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

# plot with rug distribution along upper edge
stripchart(mtcars$drat, 
           main = "a. side=3", method = 'jitter',
           pch = 20, col = 'sienna4')
rug(mtcars$drat, side = 3)

# boxplot with rug distribution along left edge
boxplot(mtcars$drat, main = "b. side=2",
        col = 'firebrick')
rug(mtcars$drat, col = 'darkmagenta', side = 2)

# histogram with run distribution along bottom edge
hist(airquality$Ozone, main = "c. side=1",
     col = 'cyan4')
rug(airquality$Ozone, side = 1, col = 'cyan4')

# boxplot with rug distribution along righ edge
boxplot(sbp$sbp, main = "d. side=4", col = 'darkorange3')
rug(sbp$sbp, side = 4, col = 'cornsilk4')

```


**Plot 16 September 1, 2018**
Fan plots show proportional differences much better than the similar pie chart, but are not widely known or used so they can be confusing unless some instruction is given on how to interpret them.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(plotrix)

# set portfolio allocations
allocate <- c(30,25,28,10,7)

# set labels
sector = c("Stock", "For'n'", "Bonds", "Gold", "Cash")
sectorcol = c("burlywood", "turquoise", "firebrick", "gold3", "green4")

# plot 
fan.plot(allocate, labels = sector, col = sectorcol, 
         ticks = 30, main = "Fan Plot")
```

At first, it wasn't clear with this plot how the total arc-span of the full plot is determined. For example, the plot above from _Graphing Data with R_ happens to plot a aesthetically appealing angle, but when I tried plotting some data on some data of my own the results were different, specifically the total arc.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# create vector
rvrslts <- c(216, 83, 22)
ls <- c("Failed", "Passed", "Ungradable")

# plot without span arg
fan.plot(rvrslts, labels = ls, radius = 1,
         main = "Fan Plot 2")


```

The arc of the fan is much wider and more difficult to take in at a glance, not to mention the title is pushed almost completely out of the plotframe. The argument that can be used to set the total arc is `max.span` and it takes radian values. For the same vector plotted above, I this time tried different values for `max.span`.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# create vector
rvrslts <- c(216, 83, 22)
ls <- c("Failed", "Passed", "Ungradable")

# plot 
fan.plot(rvrslts, labels = ls, max.span = 3*pi/4, radius = 1,
         main = "Arc max.span = 3*pi/4")

```

I tried some other values for `max.span` but with mixed results. For example, using `pi` resulted in a chart of which half looked like it was missing.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# create vector
rvrslts <- c(216, 83, 22)
ls <- c("Failed", "Passed", "Ungradable")

# plot  
fan.plot(rvrslts, labels = ls, max.span = pi, radius = 1,
         main = "Arc max.span = pi")

```

It seems like an arc of `2*pi/3 >= max.span > pi` is the best option. Values less than 2*pi/3 risk not leaving enough room for labels. 


**Plot 15 August 30, 2018**
It's fallen out of vogue because it's difficult to interpret accurately, but the pie plot can still work well to show the proportional differences of a variable with two or three levels. A study of pie charts from _Graphing Data with R_.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# create vector of investment proportions
allocate <- c(30, 25, 28, 10, 7)

sectorcol = c("burlywood", "turquoise", "firebrick", "gold3", "green4")

# set plotframe params
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

pie(allocate, labels = sector, radius = 1,
    main = "Pie Chart - Default Colors")

pie(allocate, labels = sector, radius = 1, 
    col = sectorcol, main = "Pie Chart - Set Colors")

library(plotrix)

      labelcex = 0.75, labelrad = 1.0, main = "Plotrix - 3D Pie Chart")

This visualization looks at some key performance stats for some of the biggest and most well-known teams in professional hockey. 

Data: www.sports-reference.com. Use agreement: https://www.sports-reference.com/termsofuse.html

It's also an exploration of slope charts and their implementation in Tableau as well as adding images to the hover tool window. The full dashboard can be experienced [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/conner.mcbride#!/vizhome/NHLHockeyStatsSlopeChart/Dashboard1?publish=yes).And a snapshot:

**Plot 3 - April 24, 2018**

This plot, a slope chart, was inspired by the walk-through in Ben Jones' _Communicating Data with Tableau_. The dataset is one of the sample sets that comes with Tableau, World Indicators. The dataset worked well for practicing the slope chart but the slope chart isn't necessarily the best choice for some of the indicators that can be selected. Still it was great practice, and I've added an useful plot type to my repertoire. The full dashboard can be experienced [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/conner.mcbride#!/vizhome/slopechart_exploration/Dashboard1?publish=yes). And a snapshot of the dashboard plotting changes in GDP between 2000 and 2012 on selected countries:

**Plot 1 - April 2, 2018**

Not just a plot, this example is a dynamic app that allows the user to select state and year values to plot the geographic distribution of earthquakes by the selected variables. The app uses a live API to query the USGS for historical earthquake data. The API algorithm required some maintaince work and help was provided by [other developers at StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49545608/r-what-causes-error-when-using-usgs-api?noredirect=1#comment86099289_49545608). The reactive function uses max/min latitude and longitude of the selected state to narrow the query and speed plotting. It then tests each observation point with a "inpolygon" test, before plotting. The app can be experienced [here](https://connermcb.shinyapps.io/quakes_shiny_app/). A snapshot of the app and a sample plot:

**Plot 0 - March 27, 2018**

This plot is my rendition of a [beautiful line graph](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/23/climate/arctic-ice-maximum.html) published on March 3, 2018 in the New York Times that accompanied an article by KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS, NADJA POPOVICH and ADAM PEARCE on decreases in arctic sea ice. My plot is an exercise in trying to produce similar results.

The plot was built with ggplot2 in RStudio.The dataset is documented and available from the [National Snow & Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org/data/search/#keywords=sea+ice/sortKeys=score,,desc/facetFilters=%257B%257D/pageNumber=1/itemsPerPage=25) with compressed csv files for download at a [linked FTP server](ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/).
