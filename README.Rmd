## About

This repo is a simple container for my practice plots. I work with _ggplot_, _matplotlib_, and _Tableau_ primarily to build attractive visualizations. The goal is to build a plot a day and add it to this container. As the title notes, I don't to adding a plot quite everyday...

## The Plots

**Plot 1 - April 9, 2018**

This plot from a walk-through by Ben Jones in his book _Communicating Data with Tableau_. The full interactive dashboard can be experience [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/conner.mcbride#!/vizhome/presidents_timeline/Dashboard1?publish=yes). A snapshot of the dashboard:
